## What is TriboAI?

TriboAI is an interactive application built to illustrate how ML/DL can support research and engineering in **tribology** — the science of friction, wear, and lubrication.

It bridges:
- Physical experimentation  
- Data-driven modeling  
- AI-assisted decision support  

This demo highlights the potential of AI to accelerate materials research and tribological system optimization.

## Key Capabilities

### Friction & Wear Prediction  
Estimate tribological performance indicators based on input parameters such as:
- Material properties  
- Contact conditions  
- Operating variables  

The system demonstrates how predictive models can support early-stage evaluation before costly testing.

---

### AI-Assisted Experimental Design  
Use AI to support smarter experimentation by:
- Suggesting promising parameter combinations  
- Guiding test campaign strategies  

This illustrates how AI can reduce trial-and-error and improve research efficiency.
